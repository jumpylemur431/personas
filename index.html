                <p>The interface I have selected is the Toast Point of Sale (POS) Platform at Charuma Tea Bar on Weybosset Street. In most cafes, there are multiple ways cafe-goers pay for their drinks or snacks. I, for instance, tend to use my phone’s Apple Pay method but other cafe-goers use their card’s chip, tap, or swipe capabilities. Furthermore, there are also capabilities to view the order amount, add tip, join rewards programs, and receive the receipt that adds to the user experience when paying for a drink or snack at the cafe. I am curious to see what are the varied interactions users have with the Toast POS Platform  at Charuma Tea Bar. In the cafe, I plan to sit in an area where I can view users interacting with the payment system without being invasive.

                    <ul>
                        <li>How did you pay for your Charuma drink or snack? </li>                </li>

                            <li>Can you walk through your experience paying, starting from the second after you made your order?</li>
                            <li>What did you interact with first? What did you interact with last?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>How was the experience interacting with the touchscreen of the payment system?                </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Was there any aspect of the touchscreen experience that was confusing to you? If so, what and why?
                            </li>
                            <li>What did you expect to see on the touchscreen? What appeared that you did not expect? </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>How was the experience interacting with the chip/touch aspect of the payment scanner? </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Why did you select your iPhone (or card) to pay for your order? </li>
                            <li>What motivated you to select your iPhone (or card) to pay for your order?                    </li>

                <p>Here is a brief description of the interface with the annotated (in blue) components: </p>
                <img class="sketch" src="Sketch.jpeg">
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <p>The interface sketched is the Toast POS System, specifically the part that the cafe-goer interacts with when ordering. It is a part of the larger payment machine used at Charuma Tea Bar that the employee uses to take the order, but for the means of this assignment, I will focus on the part the cafe-goer interacts with. Cafe-goers (or users) start by viewing their order on the touchscreen. Next, they either tap their card, insert the card chip, or use a contactless device like a phone with the payment scanner that is attached to the system (bottom left corner of the image). Finally, they go back to the touch screen to add a tip, select how they would like to view their receipt, and finally join a rewards program if interested. The problem it is trying to simplify is the payment experience which used to involve asking lots of questions and physically hanging over cash or a card to the employee of the cafe. Instead of using cash and needing to touch the payment system, the cafe-goer can simply tap to pay and select a few small buttons on a touch screen similar to an iPad. It is faster and more efficient when it comes to paying. Its key component is the scanner for both tap and chip which is shown in the sketch and the touchscreen to select tip, receipt method, and joining a rewards program.</p>

                    <li>Most users paid with iPhone with some hovering iPhone above the payment scanner while others making contact with the scanner itself

                    <li>Many used only one hand (left hand) to interact with the scanner, holding either phone or card

                <p><b>Question Responses:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most found the touch screen easy to understand, but some did not enjoy touching the screen so many times. Some wished the employee
                        would ask those questions instead of needing to touch the screen. Others liked not needing to interact too much with the employee. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Some found tapping on the touch screen hard as it would not pick up what they were typing. 
                        Others found it self explanatory because they are used to typing on an iPad or on their touch
                        screen iPhone. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Most found the scanner easy to use and praised its ability to use Apple Pay along with card tap/insert 
                        in one system that is right next to the screen. Those who had not liked the scanner are users who have either 
                        not used the system or have seen the system before but from another brand (not Toast) that is slightly 
                        different (ie the tap is on the side of the touch screen or the employee gives them a little scanner to tap). 
                    </li>
                    <li>Those who selected their iPhone wanted minimal contact to the system as health is a priority. 
                        Card was not as often used among the participants I interviewed. Those who used card do not have
                        Apple Pay because they had not set it up or because they do not have an iPhone. iPhone users also 
                        found it is faster to hover over the scanner than pulling out a card to tap/insert.
                    </li>
                    <li>To new users the scanner were confused as to what it was used for or how to interact with it. These users
                        did not firstly see where the scanner was and needed to ask the employee where they needed to pay. 
                        But once it was completed, they enjoyed the scanner and praised how fast and easy it was to use.  
                    </li>

She is well versed with these new payment systems like the Toast POS system, therefore she is ready for a smooth payment. This is the average user of the interface, someone who is familiar with the system as it is used in most places. The issue they face is wanting to have a fast payment to get to the next place like class or work.</p>

He is not used to new payment systems and also does not have his card on his iPhone, only the physical credit card. This persona is like some users who have not interacted with the payment system, only swiping cards or giving cash when paying. The issue they face is confusion as to what to do when paying with a system that requires touching and tapping.</p>
